Managing schedules, appointments, and time-based events in web applications can be surprisingly complex. Whether you're building a doctor's appointment system, managing meeting rooms, or handling employee shifts, you need a robust solution that integrates seamlessly with Laravel's ecosystem. Enter **Laravel Zap** – a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly schedule management package that makes temporal operations feel effortless.

## What is Laravel Zap?

[Laravel Zap](https://github.com/ludoguenet/laravel-zap) is a comprehensive schedule management system designed specifically for Laravel applications. It provides a fluent API for creating, managing, and querying schedules while offering advanced features like conflict detection, recurring patterns, and availability management. With deep Laravel integration including Eloquent relationships, events, and configuration, Zap feels like a natural extension of the framework.

## Key Features That Set Zap Apart

### 🏗️ **Native Eloquent Integration**
Laravel Zap leverages Laravel's Eloquent ORM with a clean `HasSchedules` trait that you can add to any model. This means your users, resources, or any other entity can have schedules with full relationship support.

```php
use Zap\Models\Concerns\HasSchedules;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasSchedules;
    // Now your users can have schedules!
}
```

### ⚡ **Smart Conflict Detection**
One of Zap's standout features is its intelligent conflict detection system. It automatically prevents double-bookings and overlapping schedules with customizable buffer times and strict mode validation.

### 🔄 **Flexible Recurring Patterns**
Support for daily, weekly, monthly, and custom recurring patterns makes it easy to handle complex scheduling scenarios like:
- Weekly team meetings
- Monthly maintenance windows
- Custom business-specific patterns

### ⏰ **Carbon-Powered Temporal Operations**
Built on Laravel's Carbon library, Zap provides robust date/time manipulation with full timezone support, making it perfect for global applications.

## Installation and Setup

Getting started with Laravel Zap is straightforward:

```bash
# Install the package
composer require laraveljutsu/zap

# Publish and run migrations
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zap-migrations
php artisan migrate

# Optionally publish configuration
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zap-config
```

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Basic Appointment Scheduling

```php
use Zap\Facades\Zap;

$user = User::find(1);

$appointment = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Doctor Appointment')
    ->description('Annual checkup')
    ->from('2025-03-15')
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '10:00')
    ->save();
```

### Recurring Team Meetings

```php
$meeting = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Team Standup')
    ->from('2025-01-01')
    ->to('2025-12-31')
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '09:30')
    ->weekly(['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday'])
    ->save();
```

### Advanced Schedule with Business Rules

```php
$schedule = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Client Meeting')
    ->from('2025-03-15')
    ->addPeriod('14:00', '16:00')
    ->noOverlap()                    // Prevent conflicts
    ->workingHoursOnly('09:00', '18:00')  // Business hours only
    ->maxDuration(240)               // Max 4 hours
    ->withMetadata([
        'location' => 'Conference Room A',
        'priority' => 'high'
    ])
    ->save();
```

## Advanced Availability Management

One of Zap's most powerful features is its availability system:

```php
// Check if someone is available
$available = $user->isAvailableAt('2025-03-15', '14:00', '16:00');

// Get all available time slots for a day
$slots = $user->getAvailableSlots(
    date: '2025-03-15',
    dayStart: '09:00',
    dayEnd: '17:00',
    slotDuration: 60  // 60-minute slots
);

// Find the next available slot
$nextSlot = $user->getNextAvailableSlot(
    afterDate: '2025-03-15',
    duration: 120,    // 2 hours needed
    dayStart: '09:00',
    dayEnd: '17:00'
);
```

## Real-World Use Cases
